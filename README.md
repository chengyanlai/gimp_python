##Gimp Python Fu

### Here is the python-fu I usually use, most of them are found from web, like GIMP registry.

### To the right PATH
Put *py into folder `/Applications/Gimp.app/Contents/Resources/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins`

### Make it exacutable
chmod 755 *py

You need to close gimp.app then reopen it to take effect.
The layerfx is located at Layers/Layer Effects/ menu.
Other plug-in's are in /Filter/ChenYen/ menu.
